# Description:
#
#   Default properties to be loaded for Hamcrest Nextdeed. All properties will be prefixed
#   with "hamcrest.nextdeed". Thus if you need to override a property
#   in here you have to provide the full property name. And for references it is the same:
#   To reference a property "myProp" you have to refer to it via
#   "${hamcrest.nextdeed.myProp}"
#
# Customization:
#
#   Gradle:
#
#     allprojects {
#       tasks.withType(Test) {
#         systemProperty 'hamcrest.nextdeed.reportDir', "$testResultsDir"
#       }
#     }
#

# Directory where to store reports to.
reportDir=${sys:java.io.tmpdir}

# Pattern to store images on comparison failure.
#
# The image type is guessed by the extension. Ensure that you are using libraries providing support
# for the given extension. Java supports for example by default: png, jpg, gif.
#
# Additionally available tokens:
#   * ${testTimestamp}: current time stamp, possibly denoting test starting time
#   * ${testMethodNameEncoded}: test method name
#   * ${testClassNameEncoded}: name of the test class
#   * ${testFullNameEncoded}: test class plus method name
#   * ${imageType}: ACTUAL, EXPECTED or DIFFERENCE
image.outFilePattern=${hamcrest.nextdeed.reportDir}/${testTimestamp}_${testFullNameEncoded}_${imageType}.png
