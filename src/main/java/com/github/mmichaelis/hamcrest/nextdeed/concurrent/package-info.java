 * <pre>{@code
 * Deque<String> strings = new ArrayDeque<>(Arrays.asList("Lorem", "Ipsum"));
 * Probe.<Deque<String>, String>probing(strings)
 *      .withinMs(1L)

 * While this example is somewhat academic you still might get the meaning. While the test above
 * triggers the state change, a typical system of course changes its state over time.
