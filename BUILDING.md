To debug gradle build, specify either `--debug` or `--info`.

## Local Build

\[[Home][]]&nbsp;\[[Building][]]&nbsp;\[[License][]]&nbsp;\[[Top][]]

To build locally just start the Gradle Wrapper (it will automatically retrieve the required
Gradle version for you):

```
$ ./gradlew build
```

## Uploading Artifacts

\[[Home][]]&nbsp;\[[Building][]]&nbsp;\[[License][]]&nbsp;\[[Top][]]

The deployment process of *Hamcrest &mdash; Next Deed* has been adopted according to
[Yennick Trevels' helpful hints][Trevels-2013]. Thus (unless your are not only doing a
local deployment) the first thing you need to do is to add your signing information to
`gradle.properties` located in your `.gradle` folder in your user home folder.

Just take the `gradle.properties` in this workspace as template to fill in.

### Local Deployment

\[[Home][]]&nbsp;\[[Building][]]&nbsp;\[[License][]]&nbsp;\[[Top][]]

For local deployment just call task `uploadArchives` without additional
settings and the artifacts will be uploaded to your local maven repository.

### Snapshot Deployment

\[[Home][]]&nbsp;\[[Building][]]&nbsp;\[[License][]]&nbsp;\[[Top][]]

:information_source: Snapshot deployment requires the `gradle.properties` above to be set.

To upload the artifacts after successful build to Sonatype OSS Snapshot Repository run:

```
$ ./gradlew uploadArchives -Pci
```

### Release Deployment

\[[Home][]]&nbsp;\[[Building][]]&nbsp;\[[License][]]&nbsp;\[[Top][]]

To upload the artifacts after successful build to Sonatype OSS Repository run:

```
$ ./gradlew uploadArchives -Prelease
```


## CI Build Services

\[[Home][]]&nbsp;\[[Building][]]&nbsp;\[[License][]]&nbsp;\[[Top][]]

For continuous integration *Hamcrest &mdash; Next Deed* uses several free services ranging
from CI build, coverage and dependency update checks.

### CircleCI
