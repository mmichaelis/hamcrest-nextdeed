## Release

\[[Home][]]&nbsp;\[[Building][]]&nbsp;\[[License][]]&nbsp;\[[Top][]]

The release process of *Hamcrest &mdash; Next Deed* has been adopted according to
[Yennick Trevels' helpful hints][Trevels-2011]. Thus the first thing you need to do is
to add your signing information to `gradle.properties` located in your `.gradle` folder
in your user home folder.

Deployment can afterwards just be done with:

```
$ gradle uploadArchives
```
