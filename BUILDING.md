## Local Build

To build locally just start the Gradle Wrapper (it will automatically retrieve the required
Gradle version for you):

```
$ ./gradlew build
```

## Uploading Artifacts

The deployment process of *Hamcrest &mdash; Next Deed* has been adopted according to
[Yennick Trevels' helpful hints][Trevels-2013]. Thus (unless your are not only doing a
local deployment) the first thing you need to do is to add your signing information to
`gradle.properties` located in your `.gradle` folder in your user home folder.

Just take the `gradle.properties` in this workspace as template to fill in.

## CI Build Services

\[[Home][]]&nbsp;\[[Building][]]&nbsp;\[[License][]]&nbsp;\[[Top][]]

For continuous integration *Hamcrest &mdash; Next Deed* uses several free services ranging
from CI build, coverage and dependency update checks.

### CircleCI

[CircleCI][] 

For CircleCI it is important to disable `axion-release-plugin` as you will otherwise get an error
when `axion-release-plugin` tries to determine the version. To do so set environment property
`CI_BUILD`.
